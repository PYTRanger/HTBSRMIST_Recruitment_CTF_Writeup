### Solution
Here we are given a link for a website. We use a simple and commmonly used technique to check if there is any hidden data on the website by adding ```robots.txt``` after a forward slash instead of ```?email=&password=```

<a href="https://imgbb.com/"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/jR1xyqV/chrome-3sl2m-B34wu.png" alt="chrome-3sl2m-B34wu" border="0"></a>

Hence we get our flag ```HTBSRMIST{b33p_b33p_b00p_b00p}```
