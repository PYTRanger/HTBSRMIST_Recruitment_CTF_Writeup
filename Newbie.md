### Question Statement
There was a time when I was new to this community. I joined [discord](https://discord.gg/vpWEV7bhms) and wrote my first message. I still remember that day. That was when I started as binary and now I am root hehe...

Hope to meet you soon..

### Solution
We are given a discord server link and the question is framed in first person suggesting that the Author might be a clue. Joining the server and looking up the author shows an account with the discord usernmae livey. who is the admin of the server with the role "R00T"

Putting in simple filters to look for server messages, we can see the oldest message sent by this user
