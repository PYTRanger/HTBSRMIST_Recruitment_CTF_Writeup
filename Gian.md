### Question Statement
Aryan just found out about Shreya talking with another guy but the text format they are using is kind of unfamiliar for him. Help Aryan before it's too lateâ€¦.

Shreya: 5455c33e251ab225e5c61c67e1902769 another_ guy: fed1b7d6c5bd8881557872c394003b30

What was the name of the second person in the conversation?

# Solution
We copy the code in Shreya's message and put it in the <a href="https://www.dcode.fr/cipher-identifier">Dcode Cipher Identifier</a> and find out that its an MD5 hash.
Decoding it we get the name 'Arun'

<a href="https://imgbb.com/"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/pJMyq95/chrome-nl-DFIGDAbi.png" alt="chrome-nl-DFIGDAbi" border="0"></a>


Hence we have our flag ```HTBSRMIST{Arun}```
