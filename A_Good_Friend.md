# A Good Friend

### Question Statement
I had a very good friend named Abhinav. He was excellent with locations and could remember routes to all the parks and cafes. He could identify a location just by looking at the coordinates.

> Flag format - HTBSRMIST{fake_flag}

> Author - OmArora1603

### Solution
Since the question is framed in first-person referring to a friend of the author, we look up the author 'OmArora1603' on Google and find a X/Twitter account with the same username.
Looking into the followers of this account we see and account named abhinav_764 with some coordinates in his description.

Now we search this coordinates in GMaps and find that this is a location in Connaught Place, Delhi. But this alone does not give us any sort of flag.

Clicking closeby to the marker, we can see a location pop up called Central Park. The original question statement mentioned Abhinav's ability to clearly remember routes to all the **parks** and cafes.

Hence we have our flag ```HTBSRMIST{Central Park}```
