### Question Statement
A "rot cipher" refers to a type of encryption algorithm called the Caesar cipher or ROT13 (rotate by 13 places). It is a simple substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. In the case of ROT13, each letter is shifted 13 positions.

Convert the following rot 13 into plain text:

### Solution
We are explicitly mentioned a 'rot' cipher. The instructions are pretty straight forward. We put in the given code in a Rot13 --> Plaintext converter.
