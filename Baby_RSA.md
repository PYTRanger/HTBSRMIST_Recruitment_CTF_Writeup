# Baby RSA

### Question Statement
in the realm of communication RSA is one of the technique(in cryptography) to secure communication via internet. so to solve the given Cipher text "C" which is in RSA i have provided you with the two keys one is private key and another is public key. in RSA you can encrypt message using any of the keys but to decrypt you need to use the other one(the one which is not used for the encryption)

THE TEXT FILE CONTAINS THE CIPHER TEXT(FLAG) WITH RSA MATHEMATICS

### Solution
We are given all the parameters to solve the RSA and find our answer.
We go to  <a href="https://umaranis.com/rsa_calculator_demo.html">RSA Calculator</a> and put in all the values given to us.

After decoding we get this:

Hence we have our flag ```HTBSRMIST{Y0u_Cr4cK3D_7h3_R54}```
